# Greek4Leeks
### Biblical Greek Flash Cards

This was a quick app I made for a friend who was studying Biblical Greek.

It was made with the the Unity engine. 

The code I actually wrote can be found in this file:

[/Assets/Scripts/Wood.cs](https://github.com/BoksBurger/greek-4-leeks/blob/e53bffc14b2ef3e10fa9ab4e7b8a47628f6c7660/Assets/Scripts/Woord.cs)

Considerable prep went into this data file:

[/Assets/woorde.json](https://github.com/BoksBurger/greek-4-leeks/blob/c3a3dc7523c33d1202a3cf14bb5925256a90fbc9/Assets/woorde.json)

The live version of the app can be found here:
